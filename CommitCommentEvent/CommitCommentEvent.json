This whole project needs an audit from a reasonably-trusted 3rd-party.\r\n\r\n@github This repo in distributing malware, it should probably be frozen until a full investigation is performed.\r\n\r\nI tried to look into Jia Tan some, but I couldn't find *any* information about them as a person.  Their first commit to xz was early 2022 with https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/6468f7e41a8e9c611e4ba8d34e2175c5dacdbeb4.  What's weird is that it was a direct commit, not a PR or such, though it does say that it was authored by @JiaT75 but committed by @Larhzu.  In fact, all commits are like this up until https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/8ace358d65059152d9a1f43f4770170d29d35754, which is authored and committed by @JiaT75 via https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/pull/2.\r\n\r\nMy first thought based on the name was the CCP sticking their hands in things they shouldn't, but given that I couldn't find *any* info on them as a person, now I'm just left with more questions.  Is Jia Tan even a real person?  Was this a long-play by some state actor?  If so, who?  Or was this just one person going rouge with no connections to groups or states, but if that's the case, then why did they do this?  Was this always the goal, or did something change?",
