      "body": "Based on the investigation done by Lasse Collin, the bug in #1672 is caused by the in_bytes variable being set to a negative number because zip->entry_bytes_remaining was negative. The LZMA avail_in value is unsigned, so it was treating the available in as a large positive number and trying to continue reading input. This resulted in the invalid read segmentation fault.  \r\n\r\nThis is a quick fix to the issue. I tested it on the file provided by [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) and it no longer segmentation faults. I am not sure if a deeper fix is needed to prevent zip->entry_bytes_remaining from being negative, but this will at least solve the problem in the short term. \r\n\r\nThank you to [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) for discovering and reporting this bug and thank you to Lasse Collin for discovering the source of the problem. \r\n\r\nfixes #1672 ",

      "body": "If an application or library uses liblzma and wishes the user to specify compression settings, it's currently too complicated to support any advanced settings like adding x86 BCJ filter. Currently such applications support just a preset level (integer 0-9). liblzma should have a string-to-filter-chain function. Then, for example, libarchive/bsdtar could let user specify a liblzma-specific string of compression options and pass that to liblzma as is.\r\n\r\nThe syntax to specify filter chains on the xz command line is likely a bit confusing. Using the above liblzma function in xz with  a new option would make the filter-chain specifications consistent between applications.",

      "body": "Hi! Thank you for the bug report, but I will close this bug report because it is a documented feature of XZ Utils. 7zip and XZ Utils are almost completely compatible with how they treat .xz and .lzma files, but here is an example of where they differ.\r\n\r\nMy quick maths determined this file has the settings pb = 1, lp = 3, lc = 5, which is unsupported by XZ Utils. XZ Utils will only compress or decompress .lzma and .xz files if lp + lc <=4.\r\n\r\nThis is is documented in doc/lzma-file-format.txt (~ line 105 as of 2022-07-13) and src/liblzma/api/lzma/lzma12.h (~ line 280 as of version 5.4.1). I was not part of the project when this decision was made, but my understanding is that files with lc + lp > 4 are unlikely to improve compression significantly and will use a lot more memory and computation time when compressing or decompressing. \r\n\r\nSince .lzma has been a legacy format since 2009 and .xz does not support these types of settings, we do not plan to change this. Old .lzma files that have been created with these settings can still be decompressed with 7zip and new files should be using the .xz format anyway.",

XZ for Java has not been moved to GitHub yet, so the code repository is still located at https://git.tukaani.org/xz-java.git.\r\n\r\nSo, until we move XZ for Java to GitHub, you will need to request features or report bugs either to xz@tukaani.org or the xz-devel mailing list. Instructions for subscribing to the mailing list are documented here: https://tukaani.org/xz/lists.html. You do not need to subscribe to the mailing list to email xz@tukaani.org, but then only the maintainers will be able to see your mails.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the feature request!",

      "body": "@arixmkii Eventually, I would like to support the MSYS, UCRT64, and MINGW64 flavors in CI runners. Along with MSVC CMake of course. The other ones either don't run on x86-64 (which is what the GitHub-hosted runners support), or are the same but just use clang. The clang build is already tested by the MacOS runner, so its probably not necessary to test it on Windows. \r\n\r\nI don't develop or use xz or liblzma on Windows, but we have a few users who do. My note about MinGw and CMake was more about testing the autotool and CMake builds on Windows. So, I think using msys2 makes sense since it is likely many of our users do so.\r\n\r\nTo start, I think just picking one environment would be great. I feel the most useful one would be UCRT64 if we also have CMake testing msvcrt. Since we already have a lot of runners and configurations, maybe the other environments could be in a separate Workflow that we run manually pre-release or if we are addressing a Windows specific bug.\r\n\r\nThanks for offering to help with this! I was planning on working on this soon, but I kept delaying it to work on other things. Your help would be greatly appreciated if you have the time to do it :)",

However, lzma_str_to_filters() fails with \"lzma1\" when LZMA_STR_NO_VALIDATION. This is confusing because the \"validation\" is too vague. Checking if a filter can be used with the .xz format is technically validation. So, either the code should change or the documentation should be updated to clarify this.\n\n### Version\n\n5.4.1\n\n### Operating System\n\nUbuntu\n\n### Relevant log output\n\n_No response_",

I haven't fully thought through it, but here are a few ideas I have had so far:\r\n- The GitHub Windows runner comes with CMake by default. You will not need to install it manually (https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md)\r\n- It's probably a good idea to make most of the work be done in a separate script in the build-aux folder, similar to the concept of build-aux/ci_build.sh. The reason to do this is because the GitHub Workflow .yml files are harder to test/debug since you cannot run them locally. It's a lot easier to develop the script and then use the GitHub Workflow to wrap around it.\r\n- In the script, you should be able to specify the Visual Studios build with the -g option (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Visual%20Studio%2017%202022.html).\r\n- After the generating step, `cmake --build` should compile and project\r\n- As of right now, CMake should not build the xz command line tool, just liblzma. The same number of tests should still build and pass, but I have not run these tests personally on MSVC so I cannot guarantee they will work as expected. If any of them fail unexpectedly, send us the log and we will fix it :)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps! Thanks again for your contributions so far. Let me know what other questions you may have.\r\n\r\n",

So, by default, it will install to `/share/doc/xz/liblzma`, which I am not sure if I like.\r\n\r\nI don't know of a good clean way to install to `/share/doc/liblzma` (or  `/share/doc/liblzma/html` if that makes more sense) since `$(docdir)` is `/share/doc/xz`. We can always install to `$(docdir)/../liblzma`, but that is hacky. If there is a good clean way to do this, I might be interested to try it.\r\n\r\nIf we don't like how it is now, the easiest alternative is to always install to `/share/doc/xz/html` and not care about the distinction between liblzma header only documentation and all source files documentation.

      "body": "Hi Gabriela!\r\n\r\nThank you for notifying us about this important security practice. I had not set the more restrictive Workflow permissions, so I have just updated the default to be read-only. Our CI tests are quite simple, so read-only is enough permissions for us.\r\n\r\nSpecifying the permissions explicitly in the ci.yml file probably isn't needed now that the default permissions have been updated, but it also doesn't hurt. I suppose it will keep us safe in case GitHub updates their default permission policy. If you submit a PR to update it, I will be happy to review and accept it :)\r\n\r\nXZ Utils is still new to GitHub, so if you have any other security recommendations for us, please notify us.",

      "body": "Hi, XZ Utils co-maintainer here. The problem is our CMakeLists.txt does not currently enforce the requirement for a compiler that supports C99 or add the flags needed to ensure C99. The API header files from liblzma do not require C99, just the source code and internal headers. Our Autotools build system enforces the need for a C99 compiler.\r\n\r\nWe are planning a new 5.4.2 release soon, so we will make sure to include a fix for this.",

      "body": "I think the Capsicum commits went to the master branch a bit hastily:\r\n\r\n1. It's not good to spam users with a warning message when their kernel doesn't support Capsicum. Similar spamming issue was fixed in the commit af0fb386ef55db66654ae39e2deec6e04190c4ff.\r\n2. `message_warning()` affects exit status so now xz will exit with status 2 if kernel lacks Capsicum support (unless `--no-warn` (`-Q`) is used). This breaks most use cases still.\r\n3. It seems unncessary to complicate `cap_rights_limit()` calls with checks for `ENOSYS` but I might be wrong.\r\n4. Setting `sandbox_allowed = false;` is OK but not needed as the code will be run only once anyway since Capsicum is used only if there is exactly one input file.\r\n\r\nI might have misunderstood the Capsicum API slightly in the past and thus I have put `cap_enter()` as the very last step. Seems that moving it to be the first one makes it easy to detect if Capsicum is supported by the kernel or not. So that idea in the master branch seems good.\r\n\r\n[cap_enter(2)](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cap_enter&apropos=0&sektion=0&manpath=FreeBSD+14.0-CURRENT&arch=default&format=html) mentions `ENOSYS` but [cap_rights_limit(2)](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=cap_rights_limit&sektion=2&apropos=0&manpath=FreeBSD+14.0-CURRENT) doesn't. I wonder if it is a documentation error or if it is intentional to not mention `ENOSYS`. I'm a bit hesitant to add a check for an undocumented `errno` value (I see capsicum_helpers.h does check for `ENOSYS` though).\r\n\r\nI put a proposed fix to the branch [capsicum_improvements](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commits/capsicum_improvements). These go before the new commits in the master branch which I think should be reverted so that clean patches can be cherry-picked to stable branches.\r\n\r\nI wonder if `STDIN_FILENO` and `STDERR_FILENO` should be restricted too. (`src_fd` may be `STDIN_FILENO`.) I added another commit for those. There is no worry about `EBADF` since xz ensures that the file descriptors are open. But perhaps having only `CAP_WRITE` for `STDERR_FILENO` can be too strict in some cases, I'm not sure. capsicum_helpers.h adds a few other capabilities too but on the other hand xz will only write to standard error with `fprintf` and friends.\r\n\r\nMoving to capsicum_helpers(3) could be an option but at this point I'm not sure if it is worth it as I think this should work fine too. Moving to capsicum_helpers(3) would need updating the configure test too for those who build xz from an upstream tarball.\r\n\r\n@delphij: What do you think about the commits in capsicum_improvements?\r\n\r\n@JiaT75: What kind of change did you have in mind for ax_check_capsicum.m4? One cannot check for kernel support at build time as the binary might be run on a different kernel too. Using capsicum_helpers(3) would need a change so that the build won't fail on FreeBSD 10 or 11 (which are out of support).",

      "body": "@JiaT75: I apologize for the inappropriate harsh message above. I shouldn't post when in bad mood.\r\n\r\n@delphij: OK, so avoiding non-zero exit status is essential.\r\n\r\nIs a warning message good or bad? I thought it's not good to print a warning on `ENOSYS` since the reason for the error is clearly outside of xz (kernel or emulator not supporting the syscall) and it could be annoying if all Capsicum processes showed such warnings on every invocation. But it can be argued that it's good to inform users about the situation.\r\n\r\nIf cap_rights_limit(2) can return `ENOSYS` then I suppose it doesn't hurt to check it even after a successful call to cap_enter(2).\r\n\r\nOther OSes with Capsicum support I hadn't thought about. So I guess for now it's simplest to avoid capsicum_helpers(3).\r\n\r\nI tested the new cap_rights_limit calls on FreeBSD 13.1 and they seem to work even with `sysctl kern.trap_enotcap=1` so I guess they *might* be safe to add even to the next stable release but it can be decided later.",

In fact, FreeBSD have a set of macros called [capsicum_helpers(3)](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=capsicum_helpers&sektion=3) which [wraps](https://cgit.freebsd.org/src/tree/lib/libcapsicum/capsicum_helpers.h#n153) this anti-pattern.\r\n\r\n<!-- Related issue this PR addresses, if applicable -->\r\nRelated Issue URL: https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=269185\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the new behavior?\r\n\r\nxz will ignore sandbox failures caused by the kernel lacking support of capsicum mode.\r\n\r\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\r\n\r\n- [ ] Yes\r\n- [X] No\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other information\r\n\r\nThe proposed patch modified `cap_*` calls to also check if the failure was caused by the lack of support (ENOSYS) and make it ignore it.  If possible, it's probably reasonable to just use `caph_*` calls found in `capsicum_helpers(3)`.",

The new stricter behavior was intentionally not backported to v5.2 since it seemed a risky change. So that's why the problem didn't appear until 5.4.x got into FreeBSD. I will discuss with JiaT75, perhaps it's best to not change the Capsicum code in v5.2 at all, we'll see.",

Since we moved to GitHub, it is probably less clear that is our expectation, especially for users who find the project through GitHub. So setting up a SECURITY.md file will be helpful.\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to suggest an initial version for the Security Policy through a PR. Thanks for the help!",

      "body": "Thanks for the bug report! I created a new branch [tuklib integer fix](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/tree/tuklib_integer_fix) with a potential fix for this. Can you test this to see if it builds correctly? Only the first commit should be needed for this bug, but the second should possibly silence some warnings for other users (MSVC builds).\r\n\r\nAlso, I noticed in the liblzma.wrap file that you linked uses a different mirror to pull the release. I would advise against this, since that mirror is not affiliated with us and is not as up to date as this repository. The hashes between the tag on the mirror and the tukaani.org link are different because the GitHub generated .tar.gz does not go through the same release steps that our official source code release does. For your purposes, the differences from the source code release are probably not important since they are mostly for users building with Autotools. We sign both the tags and the source code release, so either should be secure. We have released 5.4.2 a few weeks ago, so 5.4.1 is no longer the most recent stable release.",

What is the need to compile the tests programs locally without running them? Is it a cross-compile situation where you want to copy over the test binaries after everything else is built?\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, then a better solution is to override the TESTS variable in a make check command to be empty on your build machine:\r\n\r\n`make check TESTS=`\r\n\r\nThe TESTS variable, from the Automake docs: \r\n\r\n\"If the special variable TESTS is defined, its value is taken to be a list of programs or scripts to run in order to do the testing.\"\r\n\r\nSo, this is the list of tests to execute. If you leave it empty, it will still build all of the tests and then not execute any. Would this solve the issue?",

The first sentence in your commit message is a bit long. The reason we care is because in our releases the Changelog is generated from the commit messages. In order to keep this and the commit log itself looking nice, we have a few standards we try to enforce.",

      "body": "Hi! Thanks for the PR. Unfortunatly, I do not think this PR solves a problem. I am guessing the issue is with your build setup instead. If you look at `mythread.h`, the functions referenced in your error message are in the `#elif defined(MYTHREAD_POSIX)` block and should be removed by the preprocessor.\r\n\r\nIf you are using our `CMakeLists.txt`, then setting `ENABLE_THREADS=OFF` will ensure `MYTHREAD_POSIX` is never added to the compile definitions. Its possible a `make clean` or removing the `CMakeCache.txt` could solve your problem.\r\n\r\nCompiling liblzma with WebAssembly sounds like a great project though!",

      "body": "Hi! Thanks again for the very detailed PR. I looked more into wasm signal support since at first I thought it was some sort of bug that the signal emulation did not define `sigset_t` or `sigprocmask()`. This seems intentional however so your PR is certainly needed for a successful port to web assembly.\r\n\r\nWhat you have so far seems like it is enough for liblzma to build, but we also should support an xz port. This should be easy to add just by following the example of VMS in src/xz/signal.*. Since the only functions in xz that use `mythread_sigmask()` it should be enough to define signals_block() and signals_unblock() as no-ops in signal.h (and remove implementation from signal.c).\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have questions or if something else is preventing us from building xz with wasi-sdk",

My understanding is that this organization provided a GitHub mirror long before we officially moved the XZ Utils repository to GitHub. We maintain a [mirror](https://git.tukaani.org/) but that is mainly for people who had been pulling from the old official repositories.\r\n\r\nThis organization is obviously free to continue mirroring however they wish but the most up to date version of XZ Utils will always be [here](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz).",

And server uptime was unstable so I decided to create a mirror for xz.\r\n\r\nNow, if canonical repository of xz is at GitHub, there’s no big point maintaining this mirror except keeping backward compatibility. I’ll mark this mirror as deprecated and recommend users to see official one instead.",

While it is a clever idea, the redirections mentioned by @Neustradamus were all projects that moved the official repository from one namespace to another. This is different than redirecting an unaffiliated mirror to the official repository.\r\n\r\nWe announced XZ Utils moved to GitHub many months ago through our public mailing list and project website, so there is not much room for users to complain they were not notified with enough time to update their links :)\r\n\r\nAgain, @simnalamburt is free to maintain this mirror how he pleases, but we do not feel comfortable transferring the official XZ Utils repository to the xz-mirror organization, even for a few minutes. We appreciate the update to xz-mirror/xz's About section notifying users about the location of the official repository and encourage either deprecating this mirror or continuing to keep it up to date. This is important to be sure everyone is using an updated version of our project and makes it easier for us to maintain things.\r\n\r\nSo this may inconvenience a few users who need to update their links but that is the best solution from our perspective.",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nThank your for the PR. I have been wanting to add MSVC support to xz but have not had the time yet. Unfortunately this cannot be accepted in its current state because many things are preventing this from building with MSVC.\r\n\r\nFirst, there are no build system changes. We are moving away from supporting the Visual Studio Solution Files starting with the upcoming 5.6.0 release planned for the end of this year. Instead we would like our Windows users to use CMake instead to generate the Visual Studio files.\r\n\r\nSecond, there are functions that I don't think Visual Studio default C libraries support. Specifically the functions in mytime.c would still need to be ported for this to compile.\r\n\r\nI did not try to build this yet since the build system changes were not made. I did not review closely yet the changes that were made to alias functions and structs in file_io.* so I cannot comment one way or another on those.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to discourage your efforts on this. I do want xz to build with MSVC eventually but it should be done small stages. The first stage I would start with is by adding CMake support for getopt_long() replacement. The Autotools build has support for this and the replacement files are in /lib. The next stage could be porting the file_io functions, perhaps what you have already works for that. Then maybe the mytime.c functions. Eventually, we can remove the \"NOT MSVC\" check for CMake building the xz target in CMakeLists.txt when we are confident things are working well.",

      "body": "### Describe the Feature\r\n\r\nReferencing actions by commit SHA in GitHub workflows guarantees you are using an immutable version. Actions referenced by tags and branches are more vulnerable to attacks, such as the tag being moved to a malicious commit or a malicious commit being pushed to the branch.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are pros and cons for each reference, GitHub understands [using commit SHAs is more reliable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas), as does [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies) security tool.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, this would change, for example, `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744` followed by a comment `# v3.6.0` to keep the version readable. Additionally, we can take this moment to bump `actions/checkout` to `v4` and other actions.\r\n\r\n### Expected Complications\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n##### Additional Context\r\n\r\nHi! I'm Gabriela and I work on behalf of Google and the OpenSSF suggesting supply-chain security changes :)",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nThanks for the PR, this is something we have wanted to implement since CLMUL was added for CRC64. 70% speed up over the generic method is a great speedup!\r\n\r\nIf you are willing, can you do some additional benchmarks for us since you already have a framework setup? We are wondering what impact the compiler has, so can you show us differences between using GCC and Clang? This especially matters when it comes to the 3% speed up you mentioned for the inline asm. 3% isn't that significant, especially if its only for CRC32. It adds extra complexity to the code and makes it harder to maintain long-term, so we want to make sure it is worth it. Similarly, can you try making CRC_SIMD_BODY an inline function instead of a macro? This could make it easier to read/maintain. If it has a significant impact on performance then we should stick to a macro.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, can you benchmark:\r\n\r\n- Impact of using GCC versus Clang in general\r\n- Impact of  removing the inline asm (GCC and Clang both)\r\n- Impact of replacing CRC_SIMD_BODY macro with inline function (GCC and Clang both)\r\n\r\nYou don't need to make this change now, but before merging it would be great if you can clean up the commits:\r\n\r\n- Label each commit with \"liblzma:\". We do this since it helps keep the commit log consistent and organized.\r\n- Please squash commits 1, 3, and 5 into a single commit. I understand this is how you developed it and the thought process makes sense. But it will help the commit log stay cleaner if we don't have to create crc_clmul_macros.h just to later rename its variables and rename the file itself.\r\n\r\nFeel free to add fix up commits as we go through the review process but at the end we will need these changes.",

Instead, they should be looked up always relative to the current working directory.\r\n\r\nI've ran into this when cross-compiling a native LLVM compiler (to run on Windows/aarch64 and produce code for Windows/aarch64), using a cross-compiler running on Linux/x86_64. Linking failed due to errors like \"ld.lld: error: unknown file type: CommandLine.cpp.o\". The correct \"libLLVMSupport.a\" library has been available relatively to the current working directory in \"../../../../lib/libLLVMSupport.a\", but the linker instead used an incompatible version (for Linux/x86_64) which happened to be located in \"/something/usr/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib/clang/17/lib/../../../../lib/libLLVMSupport.a\". When I deleted that incompatible library from that location, the linking passed as it should.\r\n\r\nI'm attaching a narrowed-down example based on this problem.

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\n> So the core of the issue, is that the toolchain directories, `<toolchain>/lib` and `<toolchain>/lib/clang/<ver>/lib`, are searched before the current directory. Generally, one could think that's reasonable, but:\r\n\r\nI also ran into this bug a few days ago and have been investigated it a bit. I was planning on submitting a bug report today but you beat me to it. You did a better job than I would have writing it up so its good that you did :)\r\nI believe this is serious problem since it can lead to unexpected results when linking. \r\n\r\nI see in the release notes for 17.0.1:\r\n\"By default lld-link will now search for libraries in the toolchain directories. Specifically it will search: <toolchain>/lib, <toolchain>/lib/clang/<version>/lib and <toolchain>/lib/clang/<version>/lib/windows.\"\r\n\r\nIn my case, my CI toolchain caught the bug in 17.0.1. I am building liblzma.a and disabling various features and testing that the build and tests are successful. The problem is that on MSYS2 CLANG64 environment liblzma.a is installed in the system libraries (/clang64/lib/). So when building the xz.exe command line tool, it links with the system liblzma.a instead of the one in the local directory.\r\n\r\nThis causes an obvious problem if trying to build and distribute a new version of a program that depends on a library built locally.\r\n\r\nSo it makes sense why this issue did not appear until 17.0.1. The expected behavior should be to check the local directory first, then the toolchain directories. I believe this problem is only with the COFF backend since I could not reproduce it on my Ubuntu machine after upgrading to the 17.0.1 release. It possible I set up my test wrong so don't believe me 100%.",

Actions referenced by tags and branches are more vulnerable to attacks, such as the tag being moved to a malicious commit or a malicious commit being pushed to the branch.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are pros and cons for each reference, GitHub understands [using commit SHAs is more reliable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/finding-and-customizing-actions#using-shas), as does [Scorecard](https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies) security tool.\r\n\r\nIf you agree, this would change, for example, `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@f43a0e5ff2bd294095638e18286ca9a3d1956744` followed by a comment `# v3.6.0` to keep the version readable. Additionally, we can take this moment to bump `actions/checkout` to `v4` and other actions.\r\n\r\n### Expected Complications\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n### Will I try to implement this new feature?\r\n\r\nYes\r\n\r\n##### Additional Context\r\n\r\nHi! I'm Gabriela and I work on behalf of Google and the OpenSSF suggesting supply-chain security changes :)",

I'll let you all handle it.\r\n\r\nThanks for the updates!\r\n\r\n> The CRC64 CLMUL version became faster with buffers around 512 bytes. The runtime differences started to change between 32 - 1024 bytes so it was most interesting to categorize them as < 32 bytes and > 1024 bytes. So for CRC32 you are better off using the assembly version but CRC64 depends.\r\n\r\nThanks for benchmarking the 32-bit version. I would have expected the CLMUL version to be much better than the assembly or the generic to be fairly close to the assembly. We'll take that into account when deciding how to proceed with 32-bit builds.",

      "body": "@hansjans162 We committed some changes to reorganize the CLMUL code. We refactored things so all the CLMUL specific code is in a new `crc_clmul.c` file. Also, we created a macro `crc_always_inline` to force inline of `crc_simd_body()` since it was 50% slower on my benchmarks if the function is not properly inlined.\r\n\r\nA few small changes were made to `crc_simd_body()` but the speed performance was not affected. I hope if you had already started working on ARM64 versions this does not add much extra work to incorporate the code reorganzation. These changes should make the code much better organized for the future ARM64 optimizations. Thanks for all your contributions and feel free to reply here or reach out over email (the email in the project README will redirect to Lasse and I) if you have comments or questions.",

      "body": "Hi! This question doesn't exactly belong on this issue. This issue is for discussing changes to our Continuous Integration scripts for improving Windows support (which I still need to improve/finish). Anyways, I will still answer your question here.\r\n\r\n> Looks like you need to put following in CMakeLists.txt: `option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS \"Build shared libraries\" ON)` Most opensource libs like **libxml2** have this ON by default. And before cmake when I compiled XZ it was generating liblzma.dll by default.\r\n\r\nWe have always had the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option defined in `CMakeLists.txt` since we first supported a CMake build. You can search for the line `option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS \"Build liblzma as a shared library instead of static\")` if you are curious. In general, CMake defaults to `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` not being set. Other projects can choose to override this by default but since we have always had it OFF by default it is difficult to change. Applications may be relying on this default behavior if they only want the static library to be built. So changing the default to instead build the shared library could cause their build pipelines to fail.\r\n\r\nThank you for this report, but we will not be changing this.",

      "body": "> Hi! This question doesn't exactly belong on this issue. This issue is for discussing changes to our Continuous Integration scripts for improving Windows support (which I still need to improve/finish). Anyways, I will still answer your question here.\r\n> \r\n> > Looks like you need to put following in CMakeLists.txt: `option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS \"Build shared libraries\" ON)` Most opensource libs like **libxml2** have this ON by default. And before cmake when I compiled XZ it was generating liblzma.dll by default.\r\n> \r\n> We have always had the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option defined in `CMakeLists.txt` since we first supported a CMake build. You can search for the line `option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS \"Build liblzma as a shared library instead of static\")` if you are curious. In general, CMake defaults to `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` not being set. Other projects can choose to override this by default but since we have always had it OFF by default it is difficult to change. Applications may be relying on this default behavior if they only want the static library to be built. So changing the default to instead build the shared library could cause their build pipelines to fail.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you for this report, but we will not be changing this.\r\n\r\nOk, Thanks.",

If you have experience working with MSVC that is great.\r\n\r\nI imagine this would require writing a Windows PowerShell or Batch script to do things similar to what ci_build.sh does, and then refactoring windows-ci.yml to utilize the script. We need to use CMake to generate Windows Visual Studio files (using CMake's `-G` option to select the generator) and then compile everything and run the tests from Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt.\r\n\r\nRecently we ported the xz command line tool to work with MSVC so making sure we can continue to build on MSVC as the codebase changes is certianly valuable.

      "body": "Our CMake support is considered unstable and is undergoing a lot of improvements. Many of these improvements are already on master but have not made it into a stable release. If you only need `liblzma`, then using a release from the 5.4 branch will work. We will have a new `5.4.5` release later today and that will include a few small CMake changes. We recently ported the command line tools `xz` and `xzdec` to MSVC but that will not be part of any of the 5.4 releases\r\n\r\nWe are planning to release 5.6.0 this December which may change the default library to being a shared library. We may consider our CMake support stable at that point. So, to be safe you should explicitly set the `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` option if you do build `liblzma` through CMake since this option's default value specifically might not be stable.\r\n\r\nIf you can use our Autotools build system on Windows through something like Cygwin or MSYS2, that is recommended over CMake at the moment. If not, our CMake build will likely still work for you, but be careful of minor things changing in the future. We generally don't break things with our CMake build and are usually just adding more features. I hope this answers your question!",

      "body": "I can understand the confusion here. While GitHub does a lot of things well, unfortunately maintainers on GitHub have no control over the naming of the \"Source code\" release files, but we can add extra files to the release. Some projects choose to add pre-compiled binaries to the release, so it is more obvious in those projects which files you want to download (and to be sure that the source is always easily available for every release without having to clone the entire project).\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that under the hood GitHub is using `git archive` to generate the \"Source code\" archives based on the tag of the release. So it would be possible for us to exclude most or all files from `git archive` using a `.gitattributes` file to make it clear that the GitHub auto-generated archives are not meant to be consumed by users. This would be annoying for anyone who has already been using `git archive` though so I don't see us doing this.\r\n\r\nLike many projects, when we generate our source code releases, we essentially run Automake's `dist-gzip` target to prepare our documentation, translations, etc. and, as you know, generate the configure script. `git archive` does not run these steps and so the GitHub archives are best thought of as a snapshot of the git repository at the time of the release.

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\n> the installation is uncovered in the`INSTALL.generic` file. This could be rectified by an addition either of a methodology into this file or script dedicated for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is a section in INSTALL.generic \"Installation Names\". This describes when using the Autotools build system where the installation files go (defaults to `/usr/local/`). Your Linux distribution should install/update your packages in a different directory so these should not conflict.\r\n\r\nYou may already know this, but typically to build and install a package with Autotools the steps are (and should be covered in INSTALL.generic already):\r\n\r\n1. `./configure [options]`. The options can enable/disable features, dependencies, set installation locations, etc.\r\n2. `make`. This will compile the project.\r\n3. `make check`. This will compile and run the test framework to be sure the binaries work as expected.\r\n4. `make install`. This will install the binaries and documentation (unless disabled).\r\n5. `make uninstall`. This will remove the installed artifacts.\r\n\r\nYou can set a different installation location when running configure by passing `--prefix=[path to install directory]` or during installation `make install DESTDIR=[path to install directory]`.\r\n\r\nI hope this explanation was clear. Let me know if you have more questions.\r\n\r\n",

So this would fix things for Alpine, but our builds would still be broken for anyone compiling for musl libc using a wrapper like this.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nThanks for the PR. This is a great start to improving the fuzz testing. I will start with a few overall comments here and then add some more specific comments directly on the commits themselves.\r\n\r\nFirst, we need to be sure that we are using the fuzz resources in the best way we can. Its easy to think of the OSS-Fuzz resources as unlimited, but each project can only be fuzzed so much. We should only include a fuzz target if it provides clear value and is testing an important part of liblzma that isn't being covered by a different fuzz target. Otherwise, less useful fuzz targets will take away compute time from the more useful ones. So, can you justify the reasoning behind each of the new fuzz targets? For instance, I am not sure that the raw encoder and decoder fuzz targets are useful since their important code paths are already covered by every other fuzz target. The raw coders don't have important header data, its just raw LZMA data. I am likely missing an important fuzz case, but in my mind I can think of three useful things to fuzz in our library:\r\n\r\n- Metadata encoding/decoding (magic bytes, file headers, block headers, lzma2 chunk headers, etc.)\r\n- Filter data encoding/decoding (LZMA1, BCJ, delta)\r\n- Check functions (CRC32, CRC64, SHA256)\r\n\r\nNext, the code itself has a lot of repeated boilerplate. Each of the fuzz targets has very little unique code. For instance, this could be reorganized into a shared header file that provides a function for encoding and a function for decoding. These functions can take the coder init function (lzma_alone_decoder(), lzma_auto_decoder(), etc.) as a function pointer arg and any needed flags or options.\r\n\r\nWe could also consider fuzzing the various BCJ filters (x86, PowerPC, ARM64, etc). These filters are designed to be applied to executable data, but will be run on non-executable data very often. So its possible that there are hidden data corruption bugs on an unexpected input sequence since they are mostly tested on executable data, making it a good candidate for fuzz testing. These filters cannot be used as raw coders at this time, so they will have to be combined in a filter chain with LZMA1/2. If we want to look for data corruption bugs, we should encode a chunk, then decode it and compare if the decoded version exactly matches the original data.\r\n\r\nFor your commit messages, we like to keep a consistent format. When we release, our Changelog is generated automatically from the contents of the commit messages. Also it helps us maintain our codebase better when the commit messages are descriptive and clear. For your commits, please have them start with the category of what they are changing. For these, I would prepend \"Tests:\" to the first line of each commit. The first line of each commit should be a brief description of the purpose of the commit. The following lines should explain what was changed and why. Make sure to wrap the lines of the commit message to at most 73 characters since different commit log viewers may or may not wrap long lines and it helps keep a consistent look in our Changelog.",

I am going to focus on fixing the highlighted issues before implementing any new fuzzers, if that makes sense :) \r\n\r\nTo address some of your comments above:\r\n- The new fuzz targets were chosen to cover most of the `liblzma` common use cases from the code of XZ utils (i.e. we expanded the tests to cover the decoders and encoders used by the CLI utilities) \r\n- I completely agree that the fuzz targets' code can be reduced via templates and shared code. Would you like to simply move the common functionality into a separate header file, or to generate the fuzzers' code dynamically by replacing the lines in a template file as well? \r\n\r\n",

      "body": "> @JiaT75 thanks a lot for the swift review! I will start implementing the suggested changes asap. I am going to focus on fixing the highlighted issues before implementing any new fuzzers, if that makes sense :)\r\n\r\nMakes perfect sense. I noted the BCJ filter fuzzing as option to consider. We don't necessarily need to implement it or implement it right away. Just an idea of something we could also be fuzzing if we agree the value is there.\r\n\r\n> * I completely agree that the fuzz targets' code can be reduced via templates and shared code. Would you like to simply move the common functionality into a separate header file, or to generate the fuzzers' code dynamically by replacing the lines in a template file as well?\r\n\r\nI think the simplest approach would be to use a common separate header file. Creating a dynamic template would take some extra build logic whereas an extra header file would only require updating the Makefile.",

      "body": "Thank you @DavidKorczynski for the explanation and the advice for combining fuzzers. I had not thought of using a byte from the fuzz input to control the fuzzer's entry point.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, @mvatsyk-lsg we should combine `fuzz_encode_stream.c` and `fuzz_encode_stream_light.c` into just one fuzzer. We can use the same name `fuzz_encode_stream.c` for this fuzz target. We can use the first byte of input to help us determine the preset level. So the function could look like:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nextern int\r\nLLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *inbuf, size_t inbuf_size)\r\n{\r\n\tif (size == 0)\r\n\t\treturn 0;\r\n\r\n\tlzma_stream strm = LZMA_STREAM_INIT;\r\n\r\n\tuint32_t preset_level;\r\n\r\n\tuint8_t decider = inbuf[0];\r\n\r\n\tswitch (decider) {\r\n\tcase 0:\r\n\tcase 1:\r\n\tcase 5:\r\n\t\tpreset_level = decider;\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\tcase 6:\r\n\t\tpreset_level = 0 | LZMA_PRESET_EXTREME;\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\tcase 7:\r\n\t\tpreset_level = 3 | LZMA_PRESET_EXTREME;\r\n\t\tbreak;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tlzma_options_lzma opt_lzma;\r\n\tif (lzma_lzma_preset(&opt_lzma, preset_level)){\r\n\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"lzma_lzma_preset() failed\\n\");\r\n\t\tabort();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// Initialize filter chain for lzma_stream_decoder() call\r\n\t// Use single LZMA2 filter for encoding\r\n\tlzma_filter filters[2];\r\n\tfilters[0].id = LZMA_FILTER_LZMA2;\r\n\tfilters[0].options = &opt_lzma;\r\n\tfilters[1].id = LZMA_VLI_UNKNOWN;\r\n\r\n\t// Initialize the stream encoder using the above\r\n\t// filter chain and CRC64.\r\n\tif (lzma_stream_encoder(&strm,\r\n\t\t\tfilters, LZMA_CHECK_CRC64) != LZMA_OK) {\r\n\t\tfprintf(stderr, \"lzma_stream_encoder() failed\\n\");\r\n\t\tabort();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tfuzz_code(&strm, inbuf, inbuf_size);\r\n\r\n\t// Free the allocated memory.\r\n\tlzma_end(&strm);\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can test a few different dictionary sizes, match finders, nice length, modes, and depth levels with the same fuzzer.",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nThere were no changes to any of the assembly related code between `5.2.11` and `5.2.12`. I see you are using `emscripten`, so I was able to recreate your error on both `5.2.11` and `5.2.12` using:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nemconfigure ./configure\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n<inline asm>:1:1: error: unknown directive\r\n.symver lzma_get_progress_522,lzma_get_progress@XZ_5.2.2\r\n^\r\n<inline asm>:2:1: error: unknown directive\r\n.symver lzma_get_progress_52,lzma_get_progress@@XZ_5.2\r\n^\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the problem isn't a difference between `5.2.11` and `5.2.12`. Also, unless you are building on 32-bit x86 the `disable-assembler` flag has no effect. In order to build, you need to pass the `disable-symbol-versions` flag.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nemconfigure ./configure --disable-symbol-versions\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe underlying issue here is that `emcc` (and I believe WebAssembly in general) does not support symbol versioning so it needs to be manually disabled. `emconfigure` does not change the underlying `$host_os` or `$host_cpu` so `configure` will guess that symbol versioning is supported on GNU or FreeBSD systems.\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks for sharing your Dockerfile. The reason that 5.2.11 \"works\" is because there was a bug when disabling threads. See [this issue](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/issues/45). The bug was fixed in 5.2.12, so with your `configure` options you are building shared libraries again. So you can use `--disable-shared` instead of `--enable-static=yes` and this will disable symbol versioning as a side effect (symbol versioning is only enabled when building a shared library). Or, if you actually want a shared library, you can use `--disable-symbol-versions` as I mentioned before.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",

Thanks for the PR. The point about not needing runtime detection likely needs more research. From a quick search, my understanding is that CRC32 instruction is optional in armv8.0 and required in ARMv8.1. So if all processors in practice actually supported CRC32 in armv8.0, then it will really simplify this feature since the runtime detection adds significant complexity. The runtime detection likely requires avoiding ifunc and having different versions based on the platform (`getauxval()`, `IsProcessorFeaturePresent()`, etc).\r\n\r\nA note on compile time detection: __ARM_FEATURE_CRC32 isn't supported by MSVC so we will need another way to detect CRC32 instruction support there.",

      "body": "@hansjans162 Thanks for continuing your work on ARM64 CLMUL! Your benchmarks so far sound promising and will likely be a great value to liblzma. We look forward to seeing the code and further benchmarks when they are ready :)\r\n\r\nIt sounds like runtime checks will be needed, but please let us know if anyone finds reasons to contradict this.\r\n\r\nWe did a refactor to the existing CRC related files for code organization and small optimization related reasons. This change means that architecture specific CRC optimizations should go into header files that are included in the corresponding crc32/64_fast.c file. The reasons for this are best explained in the commit message [here](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/commit/419f55f9dfc2df8792902b8953d50690121afeea).\r\n\r\nBased on the refactor, @parheliamm, please put your changes into `crc32_arm64.h`, then include that header file in `crc32_fast.c`. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, Hans please refactor what you have to create `crc64_arm64.h` with your CRC64 CLMUL work (and include this file in `crc64_fast.c`). You are likely still blocked until this PR is complete since the build changes and runtime checks should be coordinated between the branches. Feel free to send us a link to your branch whenever you have something ready that you want to show us :)\r\n\r\nWe apologize for the refactor after this was already submitted, but this PR helped inform that refactor (and gave us the needed motivation to close out the branch). Thank you everyone so far for you patience and your contributions so far!\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Hello! Thanks for the detailed bug report.\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that the failing \"sample\" encoding has the uncompressed size set in the header (0x6) and also uses an End of Payload Marker. This was originally done intentionally since XZ Utils also rejected such files until 5.2.6, when it was noticed that LZMA SDK (the 7-Zip implementation) allows such files and is documented to do so. If you test this file on xz <= 5.2.5, then it should also reject this file.\r\n\r\nSo XZ for Java needs to support these files as well and we will keep this Issue open until that is added. Thanks for bringing this to our attention!",

      "body": "@parheliamm @hansjans162 Thank you for your patience on this review. We had a few other things we were focusing on (new website, release, etc.). I promise I did not forget about this :)\r\n\r\nI created a [branch](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz/tree/arm64_crc32) with some additions to this PR that will also be helpful for the CRC64 CLMUL. The extent of the edits should be clear from the commit messages and code changes, but let me know if you have questions about the changes.\r\n\r\nCan you both test this on your hardware to be sure it works correctly (and is still fast)? I was able to cross-compile it with GCC, Clang, and MSVC but I do not have an ARM64 device so I have not run the code. Thanks!",

If `size` equals 1 and `align_amount` equals 0 or 1, it ends up calculating `buf - 8` or `buf - 7`. That is, the pointer arithmetic may go beyond the beginning of the buffer, which the C standard doesn't allow (but one element past the end is allowed).\r\n> \r\n> Although it should work in practice on ARM64 (unless the buffer is at a weird address where the address would overflow but that's unlikely), I think it should be possible to avoid the problem without a performance penalty.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing this out! I pushed a new version to avoid pointer arithmetic beyond the beginning of the buffer. I also added macOS support, but I couldn't test it since I do not have an Apple device. The Apple specific code is small so it should work but I hope someone can test this.",

The problem here is that you do not have Gettext installed. \r\n\r\n`-- Could NOT find Gettext (missing: GETTEXT_MSGMERGE_EXECUTABLE GETTEXT_MSGFMT_EXECUTABLE) `\r\n\r\nPerhaps we can create a better error message here, but if you do not have Gettext installed then you need to already have the .gmo files built. These are available in the source code releases, so you should be able to build from there instead of from the development repository.\r\n\r\nThere are several workarounds here. The best solution is to install Gettext on your CI runner. It appears your CI runner is Ubuntu, so adding a step:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\napt install gettext\r\n```\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you can disable NLS by setting -DENABLE_NLS=OFF when configuring with CMake.\r\n\r\nIn CMakeLists.txt there is a bit of documentation about this in a comment near the beginning of the file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# If building from xz.git instead of a release tarball, consider\r\n# the following *before* running cmake:\r\n#\r\n#   - To get translated messages, install GNU gettext tools (the\r\n#     command msgfmt is needed). Alternatively disable translations\r\n#     by setting ENABLE_NLS=OFF.\r\n#\r\n#   - To get translated man pages, run po4a/update-po which requires\r\n#     the po4a tool. The build works without this step too.\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have further questions. I hope this helps!",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nI have seen this misconception before and I can understand where it is coming from. The short answer is that multi threaded compression mode is in fact deterministic.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter how many threads are used. @sam is correct, multi threaded encoding mode with 1 thread will produce the same as output as 10 threads. The output is *different* from single threaded mode, which is where the confusion happens. Single threaded mode does not put the block sizes in the headers and will put all of the data in a single block by default.\r\n\r\nSetting -T0 will always use multi threaded mode. In the past, if only one thread was used in -T0 mode then it would operate in single threaded mode and thus produce single threaded output. So I believe that is where the non-determinstic belief originated from, since sometimes the output would be different when using -T0. This is no longer the case.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!",

      "body": "Hello! Thanks for the bug report and build logs. Luckily, the workaround for this is very simple. With Autotools build, you can pass the flag `--disable-sandbox` to `configure`. With CMake, pass `-DENABLE_SANDBOX=OFF`.\r\n\r\nThe underlying problem here is that we assumed having the `linux/landlock.h` header file meant that the system would also have `SYS_landlock_create_ruleset` and `SYS_landlock_restrict_self` defined in `sys/syscall.h`. So the fix on our side is to add checks for these system calls before setting `HAVE_LINUX_LANDLOCK_H` during configurations. ",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nThanks for the bug report. The cause of this is because in 5.6.0 we made the default compression mode multi threaded. By default, xz will try to use the number of cores to determine how many threads to use when compressing/decompressing. If there is not enough memory to support this many threads, it will reduce the number of threads. Showing this as a warning message made more sense before because multi threading was not the default.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question, the amount of memory required per thread with default options is the block size * 2 + LZMA2 dictionary size. Block size is determined by 3 * LZMA2 dictionary size or a minimum of 1 MiB. So the amount of memory you give to xz depends on how many threads you want to be used. More threads just means faster compression, not better compression ratio. For best compression ratio, use single threaded mode (`-T1`).\r\n\r\nAnother user reported this on the mailing list, so we already started considering different options. As a user, would you rather see the number of threads actually used in verbose mode (`-v`) or debug mode (`-vv`)? We are all in agreement that this message should not be displayed by default :)",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nThank you for the feature request. Currently, we do not have any official benchmark framework for any of the XZ projects. When we develop new features that require benchmarking data, we tend to collect the files with characteristics that best fit that feature (data type, size, entropy, etc.). Often times community members will also help us benchmark since they may have access to machines, data, or ideas that the maintainers do not.\r\n\r\nAs such, we do not have any plans for a more official, robust, and structured benchmark framework at this time. We unfortunately have a few high priority tasks to attend to first. Eventually, this could be a nice thing to have when we revisit encoder/decoder optimizations to make it easier for the community to help us test various ideas. We would likely maintain a separate repository for this so it could be useful for other .xz implementations.\r\n\r\nIf you have ideas on good ways to do this or bad things we should avoid, we are always open to suggestions :) . We probably wouldn't want to actually host the benchmark data ourselves due to storage requirements and potential file distribution copyright complexities, but a bring-your-own-data framework could be useful for people. Such a thing may already exist, so we would need to start by surveying what solutions other projects use for something like this. ",

I had not found any references to 32-bit LoongArch chips, so that makes sense. Is it likely that 32-bit chips will be made? Otherwise it will simplify things to just design the code for 64-bit LoongArch and not bother with the runtime checks at all. Future 32-bit LoongArch may need extra compiler flags or a function `__attribute__()` so the code wouldn't be able to work as-is anyway.",

Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

OSS-Fuzz runs project (third party, such as xz) code in a sandboxed environment and without privileges. Malicious projects cannot harm other users of OSS-Fuzz or steal their bugs/testcases.\r\n2. OSS-Fuzz pulled the source code for xz and xz-java from the git repos. As far as I can tell, only the tarballs were compromised, not the repos.\r\n3. OSS-Fuzz did not find any interesting testcases or vulnerabilities in xz or xz-java. So adding themselves as contact did not give them access to anything important.",

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former. If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nClang 16.0.0 and older report a warning when compiling a program that uses `__attribute__((__ifunc__()))` with `-Wunused-function`. The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former. If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.",

I don't have an understanding of the backdoor yet.\r\n\r\nThe backdoor is part of a test file. It is a precompiled binary object that is being linked into the binary if it was built from the published tarball rather than git  and only if a large number of specific conditions are passing. The conditions were amongst other things checking whether it's a debian or rpm package build. A plain build will not activate the backdoor.\r\n\r\nWhile turning off ifunc is another way to protect the exploit from unpacking, in the backdoors current form it would not be necessary. Maybe it was necessary in a previous version of the backdoor that wasn't actually committed.\r\n\r\n",

Is this really related or just unrelated? Because in my opinion the architecture is not relevant (since the requirements for the backdoor are different and unrelated to the CPU architecture).\r\n\r\n> I'm stating that people packaging xz should be very wary of any code touched or given feedback on by [JiaT75](https://github.com/JiaT75) given todays security disclosure, no personal gripes to any.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. A very interesting case which seems to have been planned over a long timespan. At least that's the assumption from the mentioned commits from https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4",

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former. If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.",

This (i.e placing issue numbers in GitHub titles) is often done by new (GitHub) contributors, but the contributor here obviously is not new to how GitHub works.\r\n2. It obviously solves the otherwise obvious \"red herring\" of \"wait, the issue number is not linked/blue?? what's up?\" preventing reviewers from asking nasty questions… \r\n3.

Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former. If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.",

But the cat is out of the bag now and I see comments all over the place pinging the author. I think it's high time a bug report *here* notifies people following this tracker there is an issue. Also this serves as a request for a postmortem. Either this project has members that are bad actors or the members have themselves been deeply compromised. Most evidence seems to support the former. If there is evidence of the latter I suggest getting it out there post-haste.",

The PR updates the dependency xz to a recently backdoored version (https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/29/4, CVE-2024-3094). It is not conclusive that the PR introduces the backdoor behind the CVE, but given the suspicious circumstances I believe you should investigate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGiven the peculiar timing of the latter, the attackers could be leveraging access - most likely initially provided by the well-crafted XZ vulnerability - to spread it further. More suspicious PRs can probably be found.",

Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

You can try the following:\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\": \r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":     - The target binary crashes because necessary runtime conditions it needs\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":       are not met. Try to:\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":       1. Run again with AFL_DEBUG=1 set and check the output of the target\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":          binary for clues.\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":       2. Run again with AFL_DEBUG=1 and 'ulimit -c unlimited' and analyze the\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":          generated core dump.\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\": \r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":     - Possibly the target requires a huge coverage map and has CTORS.\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":       Retry with setting AFL_MAP_SIZE=10000000.\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\": \r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":     - Less likely, there is a horrible bug in the fuzzer. If other options\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":       fail, poke the Awesome Fuzzing Discord for troubleshooting tips.\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\": \u000f\u001b)B\u001b[?25h\u001b[0m\u001b[1;91m\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\": [-] PROGRAM ABORT : \u001b[0mFork server crashed with signal 11\u001b[1;91m\r\nStep #4 - \"build-check-afl-address-x86_64\":          Location : \u001b[0mafl_fsrv_start(), src/afl-forkserver.c:1281\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this is presumably because the exploit code is instantly falling victim to AFL's architectural purpose and design :partying_face:.\r\n\r\nSo, if I'm understanding correctly, `-fsanitize=address` is not the legitimate cause of the failures, and can is probably actually advisable to reenable to improve Security And Resilience Against The Unknown™ - right?\r\n\r\nThis comment is mostly commentary born of curiosity. I'm practically a moderately technically minded layperson here given all the dimensions. Reasoning through this aspect will be completed eventually, and maybe it's not the highest priority right now. But these threads are being read by a lot of people, perhaps a cursory explanation may prove insightful to some.",

The project recently moved to GitHub as the main repository. The old repository will still be a mirror, but it will be updated with a slight delay.\r\n- Fixed [build issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=57241) by adding an extra argument to the autogen.sh script.",

The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

I imagine just being a user of Ubuntu means giving $1 to hundreds, if not thousands, of different organizations and people. A company needs to vet every individual and company they send money to, which you could argue they _should_ be doing anyway with their software dependencies. But many of the things that come in a standard linux distro install are often somewhat abstract to the company. They miss the trees for the forest (to reverse a common idiom.)",

Is that correct? Because _that_ is what I'm saying I don't know exists. This is useful too though, thanks. Tidelift I need to take a closer look at because they don't seem to have a public demo, have to reach out to their marketing and end up on a marketing list.",

The libarchive folks say they're working on a CVE submission and in my view it would be appropriate to follow through on that when it comes along. We absolutely ought to do so expeditiously and thoroughly, but in my view this doesn't appear to be an emergency situation. With that in mind, I think it's better to follow upstream's lead (and/or CVE guidance) than to rush to cook up our own (potentially half-baked ...) rollback patches. If the upstream process somehow gets stuck, then we should reconsider, but at the moment it looks like they're moving swiftly.",

The remaining question I had was whether @Larhzu was actually created by and controlled by Lasse, but he's since stated that it's his account: https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/\r\n> \r\n> I haven't seen any reasonable claims that takaani.org is compromised, so I'm inclined to trust that claim. Reverting the commit that added Jia Tan as a contact should be sufficient to close this issue.\r\n\r\nThanks Zenexer. I think we will eventually give control back to Lasse if he wants.

      "body": "While I don’t know this code base very well, I have some concerns about the changes made to libarchive/archive_write_set_format_zip.c that I at least wanted to share. In context of JiaT75’s other work, I can see those changes introducing the following types of vulnerabilities:\r\n\r\n**Removal of length-at-end**\r\n(1) Without the end-of-data marker, the algorithm (which could also be user specified) could struggle to identify the true end (eg, the user-specified algorithm lacks a clear marker). This could lead to a number of issues with data integrity or unexpected behavior, such as memory leaks, overflows, execution of malicious code, etc. \r\n\r\n**Via a user-specified algorithm** \r\n(2) Code Injection \r\nA threat actor could specify an algorithm that allows custom code execution or manipulation of data structures. \r\n\r\n(3) Weaknesses in other compression algorithms. \r\n_See the Zip64 section, below, as an example._ \r\n\r\n(4) Data corruption\r\nThe specified algorithm may cause bugs that render the data unreadable. \r\n\r\n(5) DoS \r\nThe specified algorithm could be computationally expensive and/or have bugs that consume an excessive amount of resources. \r\n\r\n**via Zip64**\r\n(6) While I have no direct evidence, given JiaT75’s skill level, I’m concerned there may be an unknown vulnerability present in Zip64 itself and/or via an interaction between Zip64 and libarchive (eg, an odd string passed through the user-specified command or in the compressed data). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Lastly, thanks for all you’re doing to review JiaT75’s changes and maintain this code base overall. I know you’re doing this voluntarily and really appreciate the great care you have in keeping people safe.**",

The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux. Here as an example I hijack the return to go to a predefined function, but of course you could ROP instead.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"../src/stest.h\"\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include \"stddef.h\"\r\n#include <memory.h>\r\n\r\n#define without_logging(X) stest_disable_logging(); X; stest_enable_logging();\r\n#define assert_test_passes(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_passed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n#define assert_test_fails(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_failed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n\r\nstatic void example() {\r\n  execl(\"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator\", \"gnome-calculator\", NULL);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void test_stack_nuke() {\r\n  // E.g. read a wholesome file provided kindly by the XZ maintainer\r\n  static char untrusted_input[10100] = {0};\r\n  memset(untrusted_input, 'A', 10000);\r\n  *(uint64_t*)&untrusted_input[10000] = example;\r\n\r\n  // What could go wrong\r\n  assert_test_fails(assert_string_equal(NULL, untrusted_input));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test_fixture_stest() {\r\n  test_fixture_start();\r\n  run_test(test_stack_nuke);\r\n  test_fixture_end();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n  return stest_testrunner(argc, argv, test_fixture_stest, NULL, NULL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust you will fix this issue promptly, I am sure security is a high priority.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nMr. Darnell Castyte",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nClang 16.0.0 and older report a warning when compiling a program that uses `__attribute__((__ifunc__()))` with `-Wunused-function`. The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

      "body": "Hello!\r\n\r\nClang 16.0.0 and older report a warning when compiling a program that uses `__attribute__((__ifunc__()))` with `-Wunused-function`. The resolver function appears to trigger this when it is only referenced by the `__attribute__`. Here is an example program that should trigger the warning:\r\n\r\n```C\r\nstatic void resolved(void) {\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void (*resolver (void)) (void) {\r\n\treturn resolved;\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid indirect_function(void) __attribute__((__ifunc__(\"resolver\")));\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    indirect_function();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nGCC does not issue a warning for the above program. [Here](https://godbolt.org/z/9f1TnjG7h) is a godbolt.org snippet of the above code to allow you to easily test it. Let me know if you need anymore information.",

If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux. Here as an example I hijack the return to go to a predefined function, but of course you could ROP instead.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"../src/stest.h\"\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include \"stddef.h\"\r\n#include <memory.h>\r\n\r\n#define without_logging(X) stest_disable_logging(); X; stest_enable_logging();\r\n#define assert_test_passes(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_passed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n#define assert_test_fails(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_failed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n\r\nstatic void example() {\r\n  execl(\"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator\", \"gnome-calculator\", NULL);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void test_stack_nuke() {\r\n  // E.g. read a wholesome file provided kindly by the XZ maintainer\r\n  static char untrusted_input[10100] = {0};\r\n  memset(untrusted_input, 'A', 10000);\r\n  *(uint64_t*)&untrusted_input[10000] = example;\r\n\r\n  // What could go wrong\r\n  assert_test_fails(assert_string_equal(NULL, untrusted_input));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test_fixture_stest() {\r\n  test_fixture_start();\r\n  run_test(test_stack_nuke);\r\n  test_fixture_end();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n  return stest_testrunner(argc, argv, test_fixture_stest, NULL, NULL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust you will fix this issue promptly, I am sure security is a high priority.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nMr. Darnell Castyte",

      "body": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThere is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in various functions of this library, including `stest_assert_string_equal` and `assert_n_array_equal`. If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux. Here as an example I hijack the return to go to a predefined function, but of course you could ROP instead.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"../src/stest.h\"\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include \"stddef.h\"\r\n#include <memory.h>\r\n\r\n#define without_logging(X) stest_disable_logging(); X; stest_enable_logging();\r\n#define assert_test_passes(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_passed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n#define assert_test_fails(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_failed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n\r\nstatic void example() {\r\n  execl(\"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator\", \"gnome-calculator\", NULL);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void test_stack_nuke() {\r\n  // E.g. read a wholesome file provided kindly by the XZ maintainer\r\n  static char untrusted_input[10100] = {0};\r\n  memset(untrusted_input, 'A', 10000);\r\n  *(uint64_t*)&untrusted_input[10000] = example;\r\n\r\n  // What could go wrong\r\n  assert_test_fails(assert_string_equal(NULL, untrusted_input));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test_fixture_stest() {\r\n  test_fixture_start();\r\n  run_test(test_stack_nuke);\r\n  test_fixture_end();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n  return stest_testrunner(argc, argv, test_fixture_stest, NULL, NULL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust you will fix this issue promptly, I am sure security is a high priority.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nMr. Darnell Castyte",

      "body": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThere is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in various functions of this library, including `stest_assert_string_equal` and `assert_n_array_equal`. If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux. Here as an example I hijack the return to go to a predefined function, but of course you could ROP instead.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"../src/stest.h\"\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include \"stddef.h\"\r\n#include <memory.h>\r\n\r\n#define without_logging(X) stest_disable_logging(); X; stest_enable_logging();\r\n#define assert_test_passes(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_passed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n#define assert_test_fails(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_failed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n\r\nstatic void example() {\r\n  execl(\"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator\", \"gnome-calculator\", NULL);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void test_stack_nuke() {\r\n  // E.g. read a wholesome file provided kindly by the XZ maintainer\r\n  static char untrusted_input[10100] = {0};\r\n  memset(untrusted_input, 'A', 10000);\r\n  *(uint64_t*)&untrusted_input[10000] = example;\r\n\r\n  // What could go wrong\r\n  assert_test_fails(assert_string_equal(NULL, untrusted_input));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test_fixture_stest() {\r\n  test_fixture_start();\r\n  run_test(test_stack_nuke);\r\n  test_fixture_end();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n  return stest_testrunner(argc, argv, test_fixture_stest, NULL, NULL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust you will fix this issue promptly, I am sure security is a high priority.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nMr. Darnell Castyte",

      "body": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThere is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in various functions of this library, including `stest_assert_string_equal` and `assert_n_array_equal`. If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux. Here as an example I hijack the return to go to a predefined function, but of course you could ROP instead.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"../src/stest.h\"\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include \"stddef.h\"\r\n#include <memory.h>\r\n\r\n#define without_logging(X) stest_disable_logging(); X; stest_enable_logging();\r\n#define assert_test_passes(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_passed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n#define assert_test_fails(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_failed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n\r\nstatic void example() {\r\n  execl(\"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator\", \"gnome-calculator\", NULL);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void test_stack_nuke() {\r\n  // E.g. read a wholesome file provided kindly by the XZ maintainer\r\n  static char untrusted_input[10100] = {0};\r\n  memset(untrusted_input, 'A', 10000);\r\n  *(uint64_t*)&untrusted_input[10000] = example;\r\n\r\n  // What could go wrong\r\n  assert_test_fails(assert_string_equal(NULL, untrusted_input));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test_fixture_stest() {\r\n  test_fixture_start();\r\n  run_test(test_stack_nuke);\r\n  test_fixture_end();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n  return stest_testrunner(argc, argv, test_fixture_stest, NULL, NULL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust you will fix this issue promptly, I am sure security is a high priority.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nMr. Darnell Castyte",

      "body": "`archive_check_magic()` is designed to be called at the beginning of each public API function.  It helps guard against basic errors by software that uses libarchive.   Changing `archive_read_disk_can_descend()` to use a different return type might be a reasonable change that would make the code easier to understand.  But it is part of the public API (declared in `archive.h`) and so we can't change it without a major version bump.  (Any PR that proposes changing this should be guarded with `#if ARCHIVE_VERSION_NUMBER >= 4000000` to ensure it doesn't take effect before libarchive 4.0.)\r\n\r\nFor a trivial function like this, it might make sense to remove the magic check.  Again, that check is there is to help developers use libarchive by giving them a clear error when they call functions that aren't reasonable in a certain context.  For a trivial status function like this, that check is less useful.",

      "body": "Libarchive's zip writer allows the user to request a specific compression be used.   Currently, the two supported options are \"deflate\" (the compression method invented specifically for the original PK-ZIP implementation) and \"store\" (uncompressed).  This PR fixes a bug where even when the user specifically requested \"store\" compression, that would be ignored by libarchive in certain cases.  Instead, libarchive would force the use of \"deflate\" compression.\r\n\r\nI wrote the original logic here with the idea that \"store\" compression was incompatible with certain uses, but I've since spent a lot more time working with the corresponding Zip reading code in libarchive and agree with the author of this PR that I was being overly conservative and that there's no really strong reason not to use the compression that was specifically requested by the user.",

      "body": "# The problem you're addressing\r\n\r\nLow review bandwidth for contributions to Qubes OS.\r\n\r\n# The solution you'd like\r\n\r\nProposal: Base Distribution Developers = Derivative Developers\r\n\r\n# The value to a user, and who that user might be\r\n\r\nHigher review bandwidth for contributions to Qubes OS, faster review, merge process.\r\n\r\n# Proposal: Base Distribution Developers = Derivative Developers\r\n\r\nThis proposal outlines a strategy for increasing review bandwidth and development efficiency within Linux derivative projects by granting base distribution developers commit access for derivative distributions.\r\n\r\nThis proposal suggests a collaborative framework whereby developers from base Linux distributions, such as Debian or Fedora, are granted commit access within derivative Linux projects like Qubes. The aim is to leverage the established trust and vetting processes of larger distributions to expedite development, enhance security, and improve the implementation of bug fixes and feature requests in derivative distributions.\r\n\r\n_Version: 3.0_\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\n- **reviewer:** A \"reviewer\" in this context is someone with the right to review and merge (commit) source code contributions (such as pull requests on GitHub) without necessarily requiring approval from the derivative distribution core team.\r\n  - **Similar names in different contexts:** In the case of Debian, these are called Debian Developer (DD) or maintainer, a different but similar concept. A DD can upload packages to Debian which they maintain, and any other package (NMU - non-maintainer upload), subject to Debian policy.\r\n- **base distribution:** Examples include Debian, Fedora.\r\n- **derivative distribution:** Examples include Kicksecure, Whonix, Qubes.\r\n\r\n## Issue\r\n\r\n- **Low Review Bandwidth:** The review bandwidth of many derivative Linux distributions (such as Kicksecure, Whonix, Qubes) is low. This means there are sometimes complex or large source code or documentation contributions than the existing derivative core team can thoroughly merge, maintain and review without jeopardizing the security and/or quality of the operating system. This slows down development, growth, implementation of bug fixes and feature requests.\r\n- **Trust Decisions Difficulty:** Establishing trust with people far from the internet is challenging. Physical meetups such as conferences are not a magical solution either. Deciding who gets commit access is difficult. This is probably why the named Linux derivatives have only a small team of people with commit access, and new committers are rarely added.\r\n\r\n## Current State versus Potential Future State\r\n\r\n**Base Distributions:**\r\n\r\n- How to acquire commit access for the base distribution?\r\n  - Answer: By becoming a base distribution developer.\r\n    - Example: Is it possible to get commit access in Debian? Yes.\r\n      - How to get Debian commit access? By becoming a Debian Developer (DD). How to become a DD? By going through the [Debian New Member Process](https://nm.debian.org/).\r\n\r\n**Derivative Distributions - Current State:**\r\n\r\n- **Possibility:** Is it possible to acquire commit access for the derivative distribution? No. Realistically, unlikely.\r\n  - **How:** There is no defined process/path that one could point to that more or less \"guarantees\" acquiring heritable commit access, whether technologically or via a shared set of widely agreed upon protocols and principles.\r\n\r\n**Derivative Distributions - Potential Future State:**\r\n\r\n- **Possibility:** Is it possible to acquire commit access for the derivative distribution? Yes.\r\n  - **How:** By becoming a base distribution developer one has a viable path to acquire commit access for the derivative distribution.\r\n    - Example for Kicksecure: Debian developers would have an easy path to request Kicksecure commit access.\r\n    - Examples for Qubes:\r\n      - Debian developers would have an easy path to request commit access for Qubes Debian Templates.\r\n      - Fedora developers would have an easy path to request commit access for Qubes Fedora Templates.\r\n      - dom0? Intentionally left out in this proposal to see first if this proposal receives positive feedback. Could be considered later or stay as is.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\n- **Base distribution developer proposal:** Any properly authenticated base distribution developer should be able to nominate themself for review and/or commit access rights for the derivative distribution. In other words, there should be a process to allow base distribution merge access to be inherited by the derivative distribution.\r\n- **Prior contributions requirement:** This may be limited to individuals who have made prior contributions to the derivative.\r\n- **Shortcut solution rationale:** This is an imperfect shortcut solution for the low bandwidth review queue by derivatives such as Qubes. What would be the \"perfect\" solution? See footnote [1].\r\n\r\n## Advantages\r\n\r\n- **More speedy review of contributions:** The review of pending contributions (pull requests) could be sped up because potentially there might be more reviewers.\r\n- **Simplified vetting process:** The reviewer vetting process would be outsourced to larger Linux distribution(s) that have existing infrastructure to handle that. Want commit access? Simply make a number of useful source code contributions (to be defined), have credentials from eligible Linux base distributions and complete a brief application requesting access.\r\n- **Closer Cooperation with Upstream:** By encouraging more people to become base distribution developers, cooperation with upstream would improve. One can only become a base distribution developer by making useful and accepted contributions to the base distribution.\r\n\r\n## Eligible Linux Base Distributions\r\n\r\n- **Debian:** Debian is a natural choice because Debian Developers must be trusted as they have the capability to backdoor Debian and therefore any distribution based on it (Kicksecure, Whonix, Qubes Debian Template) anyway.\r\n- **Extension to other distributions:** Could potentially be extended to include Fedora and other Linux base distributions pending the definition of eligibility criteria.\r\n- **Discussion on expansion:** This should be discussed separately in case this proposal receives positive feedback. No need to engage in distribution polemics if this concept is completely rejected.\r\n\r\n## Why Commit Access\r\n\r\n- **Commit access versus review rights:** Why commit access, review, and rights and not only review rights? Because then the responsibility would still be on the shoulders of the person with commit access. The merge at the end is what gets recorded in the source control system (git). With only review rights, not much would change. Even now, anyone can make a comment that can serve as a community review.\r\n- **Importance of commit access:** Without commit access, the usefulness of this proposal would be severely limited.\r\n\r\n## What this is not\r\n\r\n- **Hard condition:** Is this an exclusive, hard condition? **No.** This does not create a hard condition. It's an additional way. It does not curtail the rights of the existing decision-makers to grant review privileges to other people of their choice.\r\n- **Exclusion of existing members:** Should existing people with commit access be removed if they are not base distribution developers? **No**. This proposal does not suggest curtailing the rights of any existing members.\r\n\r\n## Questions and Answers\r\n\r\n- **rights grant for non-base distribution developers:** Will it still be possible for the current decision makers to \"sidestep\" this proposal and grant commit access to any person, including those who are not base distribution developers? **Yes.**\r\n- **refusal of rights to base distribution developers:** Can the project current decision makers still refuse to grant commit access to any arbitrary number of base distribution developers? **Yes.**\r\n- **revocation of commit access:** Can the project current decision makers still revoke commit access at any time? **Yes.**\r\n- **public pull requests:** Can any member of the public still send pull requests as is possible prior to this proposal? **Yes.**\r\n- **absolute rule:** Is this an absolute rule? **No.** This is a living document that aims to grow the pool of trusted developers and removing development friction in order to maximize the effect of their contributions to the FLOSS ecosystem. It can be further extended or amended as needed based on feedback.\r\n- **vetting for new reviewers:** Could there be a (short, cursory, or long) vetting before adding new reviewers? **Optional.**\r\n- **base distribution developers' contributions:** Did any base distribution developers ever contribute to derivative distributions? **Yes.**\r\n- **examples of contributions:** Examples of base distribution developers contributing to derivative distributions? Intentionally left out to avoid putting unnecessary spotlight on these contributors. Since everything is public and Open Source, it's on the public record.\r\n- **realism of contributions:** How realistic is it that base distribution developers would contribute to derivative distributions? **Unknown**, but see above question. Worth trying. Effort is comparatively low. Maybe some will comment here.\r\n- **point of proposal if there is disinterest from current base distribution developers:** What's the point if no base distribution developers are interested to apply for derivative distribution merge access anyhow? Then at least derivative contributors can be pointed to a viable path on how they can get commit access to the derivative distribution - by first becoming a base distribution developer.\r\n- **distribution developer rationale:** What is so special about becoming a base distribution developer? It is hard, time-consuming, requires a learning process, going through the proverbial school of the base distribution, social skills and includes a vetting process.\r\n- **upload rights:** Build/upload rights for releases and/or binary packages are a separate right and are not covered by merely having source commit access.\r\n\r\n## Qubes Specific\r\n\r\n- **prerequisite knowledge:** [Qubes Core Reviewer (QCR)](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/package-contributions/)\r\n- **commit access to Qubes core packages:** Does this mean, a base distribution developer would necessarily get commit access to Qubes core packages such as qubes-core-agent-linux? **No**, not necessarily. The concept of maintainers could be kept. A package maintainer of a package or QCR could remain the only reviewer deciding what is permissible to be merged.\r\n  - **NMU policy:** There is no policy suggestion for NMU (non-maintainer upload) in Qubes yet. Such as when no uploader (QCR?) is (planned or unexpectedly) unavailable. For example, a selection and/or quorum of a minimum number of base distribution developers might be allowed to perform NMU. Such things could be considered at a later point in case this proposal receives positive feedback.\r\n- **QubesOS-contrib eligibility:** A base distribution developer could be eligible to add packages to QubesOS-contrib, perhaps without even needing a second reviewer, but this would be optional. Another option would be that two base distribution developers would be eligible to add packages without requiring a review by QCR.\r\n\r\n## Footnotes\r\n\r\n- [1] The \"perfect\" solution would be for the derivative to develop and maintain a member mechanism similar to [Debian New Member Process](https://nm.debian.org/). This would also require forking related policies such as [Debian Constitution](https://www.debian.org/devel/constitution), [Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianFreeSoftwareGuidelines), [Debian Policy](https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/), among an unknown number of other important policies and processes. However, this would be very hard, time-consuming, require reducing development activities, and a strong focus on the development of an organisational structure. This is presumably why that has not been done yet and is unlikely to happen soon.\r\n\r\n## Improvements to this Proposal\r\n\r\n- Suggestions welcome.\r\n- This is just a proposal. Instead of dismissing it, how can it be improved to be made suitable?\r\n- The core team is obviously free to make any changes of their liking.\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n\r\n- **no conflict of interest:** I am not a base distribution developer myself, neither did I start the process to become one at this point. I would therefore not personally benefit from this policy suggestion.\r\n- **proposal origin:** Did any base distribution developer suggest this? **No**, Patrick invented this idea without prior counseling with any base distribution developers.\r\n- Speaking for myself only.\r\n\r\n## See Also\r\n\r\n- [https://producingoss.com/en/committers.html](https://producingoss.com/en/committers.html)\r\n- [https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/contributing/commit_rights/](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/contributing/commit_rights/)\r\n- [https://medium.com/@elombrozo/the-bitcoin-core-merge-process-74687a09d81d](https://medium.com/@elombrozo/the-bitcoin-core-merge-process-74687a09d81d)\r\n",

      "body": "Good afternoon,\r\n\r\nThere is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in various functions of this library, including stest_assert_string_equal and assert_n_array_equal. If the library is used to test untrusted input (for example, a file you found in [tukaani-project/xz](https://github.com/tukaani-project/xz)) a devious individual would be able to construct a malicious file to achieve arbitrary code execution on anyone running the tests.\r\n\r\nI have included an example of how it might look on x86_64 Linux. Here as an example I hijack the return to go to a predefined function, but of course you could ROP instead.\r\n\r\n```c\r\n#include \"../src/stest.h\"\r\n#include <stdint.h>\r\n#include <stdlib.h>\r\n#include <unistd.h>\r\n#include <stddef.h>\r\n#include <memory.h>\r\n\r\n#define without_logging(X) stest_disable_logging(); X; stest_enable_logging();\r\n#define assert_test_passes(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_passed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n#define assert_test_fails(X) without_logging(X); stest_assert_last_failed(__FUNCTION__, __LINE__);\r\n\r\nstatic void example() {\r\n  execl(\"/usr/bin/gnome-calculator\", \"gnome-calculator\", NULL);\r\n}\r\n\r\nstatic void test_stack_nuke() {\r\n  // E.g. read a wholesome file provided kindly by the XZ maintainer\r\n  static char untrusted_input[10100] = {0};\r\n  memset(untrusted_input, 'A', 10000);\r\n  *(uint64_t*)&untrusted_input[10000] = example;\r\n\r\n  // What could go wrong\r\n  assert_test_fails(assert_string_equal(NULL, untrusted_input));\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid test_fixture_stest() {\r\n  test_fixture_start();\r\n  run_test(test_stack_nuke);\r\n  test_fixture_end();\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n  return stest_testrunner(argc, argv, test_fixture_stest, NULL, NULL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust you will fix this issue promptly, I am sure security is a high priority.",

The LZMA avail_in value is unsigned, so it was treating the available in as a large positive number and trying to continue reading input. This resulted in the invalid read segmentation fault.  \r\n\r\nThis is a quick fix to the issue. I tested it on the file provided by [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) and it no longer segmentation faults. I am not sure if a deeper fix is needed to prevent zip->entry_bytes_remaining from being negative, but this will at least solve the problem in the short term. \r\n\r\nThank you to [icycityone](https://github.com/icycityone) for discovering and reporting this bug and thank you to Lasse Collin for discovering the source of the problem. \r\n\r\nfixes #1672 ",
